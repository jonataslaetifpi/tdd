# DES-OR (Desenvolvimento Orientado e Testes - Test-Driven Development)

## Introduction
In this repository, there'll be all the code solutions passed by professor of the course DES-OR (Desenvolvimento Orientado e Testes - Test-Driven Development)

## Branches
For purpose of this course, there won't be a branch named develop. Each branch will have the name of the day in which the activity was passed by the Professor. Also, there'll be a branch for all solutions on that month. For example, on 5 March 2022, the Professor passed the task one and task two, and on 6 March 2022 he passed the task three, and on 1 April 2022 he passed the task four and task five. In this example, there'll be the following branches between quotes: "20220305" containing the code solutions for tasks one and task two; "20220306" containing the code solution for task three; "20220401" containing the solutions for task four and task five; "202203" containing all the solutions for tasks passed on March 2022; and "202204" contaning all the solutions on April 2022.
